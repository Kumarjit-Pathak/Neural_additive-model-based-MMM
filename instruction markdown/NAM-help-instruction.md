during all the fixes you have done . you learned about many best practices on the  
  modelling part as it was not working earlier there were lots of issues which you needed to fix. Now it's time to share the knowledge to students .  for all of these take a persona of Kumarjit Pathak (Myshelf) and be funny so that students get's really interested reading this.
  
  Create a model_learning_kp.md file 
  
  1. Showing objective of the model. 

  2. model architecture - explain in details

  3. what data is available ?

  3. Data processing details - for example what transformation and scaling is used andy why  Show the final data sample(5 rows) entering going to the model
  
  Now all the issues you have faced , transform them into best practice for the a data science student to learn effectively . use examples    from this code or the issues you faced . this should be a step by step guiding document for    
  the student, with easy language detailed explanation . 
  
  Use the visualizations you have generated as well along with  results you have got from the model to show them how the output looks like after 100  epochs .
